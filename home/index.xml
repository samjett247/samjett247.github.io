      <description>About the Website My name is Sam Jett. I recently graduated from the University of Oklahoma with my MS in mechanical engineering, with research focus on heart valve biomechanics and microstructural imaging. Since graduating, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working as a data scientist with a biomedical device startup called Modulim.
This website documents the projects and activities I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about; it serves as a portfolio of my experiences and interests. By reading through it, I hope that you will learn a little bit more about what I have done and what I want to do.</description>
