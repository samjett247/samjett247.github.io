# About the Website

My name is Sam Jett. I recently graduated from the University of Oklahoma with my MS in mechanical engineering, with research focus on heart valve biomechanics and microstructural imaging. Since graduating, I've been working as a data scientist with a biomedical device startup called Modulim. 

This website documents the projects and activities I'm passionate about; it serves as a portfolio of my experiences and interests. 
By reading through it, I hope that you will learn a little bit more about what I have done and what I want to do.

After reading, I hope that you get in touch via the contact link at the bottom, so I can learn a little bit more about you. Thank you!
