I would like to acknowledge many people for their assistance and support.

* My parents and friends, because I wouldn't have made it where I am today without them.

* Matt McCraney, for believing in me and helping me to achieve my goals inside and outside of Crossfit.

* Dr. Chung-Hao Lee, for mentoring my research and his constant passion to help me learn and grow.

* Zach Schuermann, for his generous consulting on any computer-related issue and his help with this website.
