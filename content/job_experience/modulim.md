I started working as an R&D Scientist with Modulim in July, 2019. The company's main product, the **Clarifi** imaging system, uses a series of modulated illumination patterns to extract maps of 5 oxygenation biomarkers. It is our belief that information from these maps can help to provide earlier diagnosis and prevention of *Diabetic Foot Ulcers*, a dangerous condition that can lead to limb amputation. 

I'm excited to support R&D at Modulim as we work with physicians and hospitals to help draw conclusions from clinical images and trials. We hope that the imaging device, employing the unique *SFDI* technology, will provide novel insights into the causes for diabetic foot ulcers, and help to prevent the onset of these quite literally crippling diseases.
