I spent the summer of 2017 working for Northrop Grumman as an Electronics and Payloads Intern in Melbourne, Florida. Although much of the work that I completed over the internship was classified *For Official Use Only*, I can share basic details about the assignments. My work over the summer consisted of 3 main assignments: **1.** Writing **Visual Basic** code for an employee query macro, **2.** Decomposing government-issued requirements documents to help guide design and details for a contract bid, and **3.** Examining communications terminals on existing warfighters for potential use on alternative projects, involving heavy research into the schematics and communications infrastructure of existing warfighters. Through these projects, I also learned about the structure of the large government contractor; I learned how the proposals are bid for by a given team, and how a different team develops the product to meet the requirements. I learned about the extensive regulations that accompany fulfilling contracts filed by the federal government, and about the intensive safety factor in any product designed for the military. Iâ€™m thankful to Northrop Grumman for the chance to learn about the aerospace industry from a position within one of the biggest defense contractors in the United States.
