From August to December of 2018, I worked at an internship in the Oklahoma City area. The internship provided many opportunities for developing scripts in a process automation program called UIPath and in VBA; However, the internship also showed me just how demoralizing and frustrating long commutes can be -- my commute typically varied from about 30 minutes to an hour. Fortunately, this internship had flexible hours, so I was allowed to choose when I wanted to drive to/from work. But I relied on heuristics to decide the best commute time, and I felt this heuristic-based approach might be inaccurate. So I decided to build an app to provide users with quantitative data concerning how their commute time varied depending on when they left. I used one of the Google Maps APIs to obtain my data, and built an app to display this data in Flask with Python. Please check the app out via the link below if you're interested, I hope it can help.

For an example, the below image shows the analysis for my commute to work for the internship last semester.
